## Adding meaning to tokens: The Parser

The parser adds meaning to your code by analysing the tokens generated by the lexer. While the lexer simply looks     for "IF" and creates an "IF" token, the parser knows what an IF statement is, and in what order     the tokens need to be in to make one. It denotes expressions, and so much more. As an example, it tells Spindle to     handle a specific group of tokens as a for loop, and tells the interpreter to handle all the logic for it. The     Interpreter is the next step after the lexer. Syntax checking is a lot more rigorous in the Parser, and this is     where syntax errors usually come from. The Parser is the largest and most complicated part of Spindle, as it     _literally_ handles your program's logic. Because of its size and complexity, I will have to summarize it     here. If you wish, you may expand upon this.

It also tells Spindle what do to if it encounters a "RETURN" statement.
    In a sense, it turns:     `[INT:10,PLUS,INT:5]`     Into [INT: 15].
