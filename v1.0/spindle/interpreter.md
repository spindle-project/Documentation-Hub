# Interpreter

The `Interpreter` class is responsible for executing the Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) generated by the parser. It "visits" each node in the AST and performs the corresponding actions, effectively running the program. This process is often referred to as "tree traversal" or "interpretation."

## Class: `Interpreter`

The `Interpreter` class utilizes a visitor pattern to handle different types of AST nodes. Each `visit_` method is tailored to execute the specific logic for that node type.

### `visit(self, node, context)`

**Purpose:** This is the central dispatch method that determines which specific `visit_` method to call based on the type of the `node` being processed.

**Parameters:**

* `node`: The current node in the Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) being visited. This node represents a specific construct in the programming language (e.g., a number, an operation, a variable assignment).

* `context`: The current execution context, which includes the symbol table (for storing variables and functions), the parent context, and other relevant runtime information.

**Explanation:**

1. **Method Name Construction:**

   ```python

   method_name = f'visit_{type(node).__name__}'
